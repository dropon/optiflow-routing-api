### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	openapiclient "github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID"
)

func main() {
	waypoints := []string{"Inner_example"} // []string | The list of waypoints the route will be calculated for. At least two waypoints are necessary, a maximum number may apply according to your subscription. The first waypoint is the start and the last is the destination of the route. Additional intermediate waypoints are possible.   The format of each waypoint is `<lat>,<lon>[;<attribute>;<attribute>;...]` representing a point with the latitude value in degrees from south to north and the longitude value in degrees (WGS84/EPSG:4326) from west to east. This point will be matched to the nearest possible road.   By default the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates is not included in the route polyline, distance and duration. We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _on-road waypoint_.  The behaviour of a waypoint can be changed by appending the following attributes:    * `includeLastMeters` to include the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates in the route polyline, distance and duration.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _off-road waypoint_.  * `roadAccess=<lat>,<lon>`, to use these coordinates for matching to the nearest road. Implies **includeLastMeters**, i.e.  the air-line connection between the waypoint coordinates and the matched coordinates  is included in the route polyline, distance and duration. This is useful if the waypoint should not be matched to the nearest possible road but to some road further away,  e.g. garage exit at a different road.  * `matchSideOfStreet`, specifies that this waypoint will be reached at the side of street on which it is located.  This is useful to prevent the driver from crossing the street to actually reach the location represented by this waypoint.  * `radius=<distance>`, influences the route course, so that the route passes an area defined by the given radius [m] (integer value).  This waypoint will not appear as a waypoint event in the response and may not be used as start and destination.  `radius` must be > 0 and is not compatible with any other attribute on the same waypoint except for `name`.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as a _route-manipulation waypoint_.  * `name=<name of waypoint>`, is an identifier to reference this waypoint in the response.  * In order to influence the route course so that the route uses a specific ferry or railway connection between two locations the waypoint is formatted as follows:  `combinedTransport=<lat>,<lon>,<lat>,<lon>`. Both locations will be matched to the nearest ports looking for a direct connection.  If no connection can be found, this waypoint will be ignored, and the warning _ROUTING_COMBINED_TRANSPORT_WAYPOINT_IGNORED_ will be returned.  If more than one connection is found, the best one will be used,  and the alternative connections will be returned in the response in a warning _ROUTING_COMBINED_TRANSPORT_WAYPOINT_AMBIGUOUS_.  This waypoint will not appear as a waypoint event in the response and may not be used as start or destination.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as a _combined-transport waypoint_.   See [here](./concepts/waypoints) for more information. (optional)
	routeId := "3a58b824-fa8b-47eb-a5b8-73d6b753e1b4" // string | Instead of the waypoint mentioned above, a **routeId** from a previously calculated route or a matched track can be entered. More information and applying restrictions can be found [here](./concepts/waypoints). (optional)
	profile := "profile_example" // string | A profile defines a vehicle by a set of attributes, matching typical transport situations. It must be the name of one of the [predefined profiles](../data-api/concepts/profiles) such as _EUR_TRAILER_TRUCK_.  If this parameter is not specified and the first waypoint or the routeId is located in the Americas, _USA_8_SEMITRAILER_5AXLE_ is used as the default instead of _EUR_TRAILER_TRUCK_.  If the first waypoint or the routeId is located in the Americas but a non-American profile is specified or vice-versa, a warning is returned (routing only). Always use a profile which matches the region of the waypoints to obtain best results.  If the attributes of the profile do not fit to your vehicle, the values can be changed by the corresponding attributes in the **vehicle** parameter (routing only).  The values of the predefined profiles may be adapted to reflect current vehicle standards. To obtain the same results when values change, it is recommended to  always send with the request the **vehicle** parameters that are important for your use case. (optional) (default to "EUR_TRAILER_TRUCK")
	vehicle := *openapiclient.NewVehicle() // Vehicle | Physical and legal properties of the vehicle such as its dimensions to override the values of the selected **profile**.

Use array notation like `emissionOptions[calculationMethods]=ISO14083_2023` to set options.  This parameter supersedes emission-related values in **results**.  If specified the emission-related values in **results** will be ignored. (optional)
	monetaryCostOptions := *openapiclient.NewMonetaryCostOptions() // MonetaryCostOptions | Relevant options to report the monetary costs of a route when _MONETARY_COSTS_ are requested in the **results**. Used for monetary cost routing when **options[routingMode]=MONETARY** is set. The costs have to be specified in the currency that is set in **options[currency]**. (optional)
	results := []openapiclient.Results{openapiclient.Results("ROUTE_ID")} // []Results | Comma-separated list that defines which results will be returned. _TOLL_COSTS_, _TOLL_SECTIONS_, _TOLL_SYSTEMS_ and _TOLL_EVENTS_ will be ignored for non-motorized profiles such as _BICYCLE_ or _PEDESTRIAN_.

### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	openapiclient "github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID"
)

func main() {
	routeRequest := *openapiclient.NewRouteRequest() // RouteRequest | 
	profile := "profile_example" // string | A profile defines a vehicle by a set of attributes, matching typical transport situations. It must either be the name of one of the [predefined profiles](../data-api/concepts/profiles) such as _EUR_TRAILER_TRUCK_ or a UUID of a predefined [vehicle model](../data-api/code-samples/vehicle-models) from the Data API.  If this parameter is not specified and the first waypoint or the routeId is located in the Americas, _USA_8_SEMITRAILER_5AXLE_ is used as the default instead of _EUR_TRAILER_TRUCK_.  If the first waypoint or the routeId is located in the Americas but a non-American profile is specified or vice-versa, a warning is returned (routing only). Always use a profile which matches the region of the waypoints to obtain best results.  If a model of an electric vehicle is used, the electricity consumption of the concrete vehicle model can be calculated. Some parameters like **vehicle[engineType]** cannot be used with a model of an electric vehicle. Those parameters are automatically filled as applicable from the selected model.  Please refer to the [concept](./concepts/model-based-ev-consumption-calculation) to see specifically which parameters are not compatible. These vehicle model profiles are in a preview state, the API is stable, feature changes could be introduced in future.  If the attributes of the profile do not fit to your vehicle, the values can be changed by the corresponding attributes in the **vehicle** parameter (routing only).  The values of the predefined profiles may be adapted to reflect current vehicle standards. To obtain the same results when values change, it is recommended to  always send with the request the **vehicle** parameters that are important for your use case.

## GetEstimatedTimeOfArrival

> EtaResponse GetEstimatedTimeOfArrival(ctx, routeId).Waypoint(waypoint).Position(position).Time(time).WorkLogbook(workLogbook).Execute()





### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
    "time"
	openapiclient "github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID"
)

func main() {
	routeId := "38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d" // string | The route ID returned from a previous route calculation. See [here](./concepts/waypoints) for more information.  Make sure to assign unique names to all off-road and on-road waypoints in the request to obtain the route ID. Otherwise, the route ID cannot be used for ETA calculation because the waypoints cannot be identified. Furthermore, the route ID must not contain route-manipulation waypoints, combined-transport waypoints or vehicle parameters at waypoints. 
	waypoint := *openapiclient.NewPositionAtWaypoint("Name_example") // PositionAtWaypoint |  (optional)
	position := *openapiclient.NewPositionOnRoute(float64(49.480301), float64(6.110667), "NextWaypointName_example") // PositionOnRoute |  (optional)
	time := time.Now() // time.Time | Defines the time when the vehicle position was captured formatted according to [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). If not specified the current time will be used, i.e. the given position of the vehicle is its current position.  If the date-time string does not include an explicit offset to UTC, the time will be interpreted as the local time of the position of the vehicle. The date must not be before 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 nor after 2037-12-31T23:59:59+00:00.  The response will contain the offset to UTC specified in the request, otherwise it will contain the offset to UTC of the position of the vehicle. For best results the time should be only several minutes in the past or in the future, otherwise live traffic will not be considered properly. (optional)
	workLogbook := *openapiclient.NewWorkLogbook(time.Now()) // WorkLogbook |  (optional)

	configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
	apiClient := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
	resp, r, err := apiClient.RoutingAPI.GetEstimatedTimeOfArrival(context.Background(), routeId).Waypoint(waypoint).Position(position).Time(time).WorkLogbook(workLogbook).Execute()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `RoutingAPI.GetEstimatedTimeOfArrival``: %v\n", err)
